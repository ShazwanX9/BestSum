# Choose Best Summation

___
    Find the best fit to lookup value                       (ref_val)
    By calculating the sum of combination n number          (size) 
    From list of integer provided                           (ls)
___

    Required:
        :param:  -> int     - (ref_val)
        :param:  -> int     - (size)
        :param:  -> list    - (ls)
        :return: -> int     - the nearest at most of int ref_val

    Example:
        choose_best_sum(39, 3, [14, 14, 3, 7, 14, 21, 5, 12, 23, 22, 16, 11, 23, 12, 16, 18, 1])
            => (14, 14, 11), 39
